Input Changes:

Currently:
 - Only can check if a key is down currently


Goal:
  - Check if a key/button was pressed since last update
  - Check if a key/button is currently pressed <-- Today's func
  - Check if a key/button was released since last update

Plan of attack:
  - Create an update event handler that keeps track of new key/button press
  - Create an update event handler that keeps track of new key/button releases
  - Cleanup some stuff to get Input less janky...
